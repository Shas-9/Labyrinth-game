# OOP Project

We're nerds so we're starting this weeks in advance

#Getting started
Clone the repo and run "make all" in the terminal
If everything works fine then test.cpp and foo.cpp should run
"Hello from the printHello function" should be written on terminal
and a small sfml window should pop up
